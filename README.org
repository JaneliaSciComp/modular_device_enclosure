** Description

   This repository contains the files for constructing enclosures for modular
   devices.

* Assembly Instructions

  - Count modular devices of each form factor for a particular setup and choose
    the appropriate dxf file.
  - Choose appropriate size of 0.125 inch thick acrylic sheet and cut out dxf
    file using a laser cutter.
  - Press captive nuts into each of the small mounting holes.
  - Insert one 0.375 inch cap screw into each hole on the modular device base
    pcb marked with a white circle and screw a round threaded standoff onto the
    other side.
  - Align header pins of the top pcb with the sockets of the modular device base
    and press the top pcb onto the base until it is firmly seated.
  - On the 5x3 form factor modular devices, place one of the round unthreaded
    spacers between the top pcb and the base pcb at the two mounting holes
    furthest from the header pins.
  - Place one nylon washer onto each of the 1.25 inch cap screws and insert one
    of the screws with a washer into each of the mounting holes on the top pcb
    marked with a white circle.
  - Align the 1.25 inch cap screws with the captive nuts pressed into the
    acrylic and screw each one in firmly, but not so tightly as to bend the
    acrylic.
